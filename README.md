## About the Project

Built with :heart: for students and novice programmers, this tool is more than just a visualizer - it's your companion in the exciting journey of learning and understanding a fundamental concept in computer science and a stepping stone into the universe of algorithmic thinking. Whether you're a student grappling with the basics or a new programmer sharpening your skills, visualizing these algorithms can transform abstract concepts into tangible understanding.

## Features:

**Visualize Sorting Algorithms:** Experience algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, under the hood!

**Future Updates:** We're not stopping here! Planned future updates include Visualizing List and Tree Traversals.

## Getting Started:

### Prerequisites:

- **Node.js:** This project requires you to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

  - _Download and install it for running the application and managing dependencies._

- **Code Editor:** You will also need a code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

  - _Download and install for writing and navigating through the project's codebase._

### Installation:

1. Clone the Repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mauiwowie88/sorting-visualizer.git
   ```
2. Open your Command Line & Paste Cloned Repo
3. Navigate to the Project Directory
   ```
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```
4. Open Project in Code Editor
   ```
   code .
   ```
5. Install Dependencies
   ```
   npm i
   ```
6. Start Application
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## How it Works:

1. **Select an Algorithm:** Choose from a variety of sorting algorithms.
2. **Adjust the Parameters:** Customize the size and speed of the visualization.
3. **Watch, Learn, and Experiment:** Observe how different algorithms sort data in real-time and

Happy Coding! :keyboard:
