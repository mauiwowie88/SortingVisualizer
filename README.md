Sorting Algorithm Visualizer :bar_chart: :sparkles:
Welcome to the World of Algorithms!
About the Project :books:
Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is your go-to interactive guide designed to unravel the mysteries of sorting algorithms! Built with :heart: for students and budding programmers, this tool is more than just a visualizer - it's your companion in the exciting journey of learning and understanding the fundamental algorithms that power the digital world.

Why Sorting Algorithms?
Sorting is a fundamental concept in computer science and a stepping stone into the universe of algorithmic thinking. Whether you're a student grappling with the basics or a new programmer sharpening your skills, visualizing these algorithms can transform abstract concepts into tangible understanding.

Features :sparkler:
Visualize Common Sorting Algorithms: Experience algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more in action!
Interactive and Fun: Who says learning can't be fun? Our playful and interactive interface makes learning a joy.
Step-by-Step Explanation: Each step in the algorithm is explained in a beginner-friendly way, making complex concepts accessible.
Future Updates: We're not stopping here! Planned future updates include visualizing list and tree traversals.
Getting Started :rocket:
